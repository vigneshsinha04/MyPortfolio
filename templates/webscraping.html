              <p>Web scraping, web harvesting, or web data extraction is data scraping used for extracting data from websites. Web scraping software may access the World Wide Web directly using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, or through a web browser. While web scraping can be done manually by a software user, the term typically refers to automated processes implemented using a bot or web crawler. It is a form of copying, in which specific data is gathered and copied from the web, typically into a central local database or spreadsheet, for later retrieval or analysis.</p>
              <p>For example, we want some set of data from a website for our use. As a programmer, we do not manually go and fetch the data. Instead we let our program do the job. I have developed such tool that fetches data from the website called <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/" target="_blank">hackernews</a>. This website is dedicated for tech news from all over the world. So, I wanted to fetch only those news that have upvotes of more than 100. By using this tool, I can get it in seconds. This way, I will save a lot of time and avoid going through the website and filter news manually. I have developed this tool in Python using BeautifulSoup.
