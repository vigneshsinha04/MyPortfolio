              <p>Tic-tac-toe, or noughts and crosses, or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.</p>
              <p>Here I have developed a simple game of classic Tic-Tac-Toe using Python. This game is played by two players X and O. By default, X will start the game.</p>
              <p>Some interesting facts of game combinations when X starts the game.
                <ul>
                  <li>91 distinct positions are won by (X)</li>
                  <li>44 distinct positions are won by (O)</li>
                  <li>3 distinct positions are drawn (often called a "cat's game")</li>
                </ul>
